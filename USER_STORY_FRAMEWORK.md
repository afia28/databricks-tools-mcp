### The Two Frameworks

| Framework | Purpose | Command | Input | Output | Time |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------|--------|------|
| **Definition** (NEW) | Generate user stories | `/define-user-story` | Feature description | Complete story | 5-10 min |
| **Execution** (Existing) | Implement stories | `/implement-user-story` | Story ID | Production code | 30-45 min |

**Combined Power**: Idea → Production in ~45 minutes with 99% test coverage!

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Define a Feature

```bash
/define-user-story "Add query result caching to improve performance for frequently accessed tables"
```

**What Happens:**
- 🟠 Story-architect analyzes your request
- 🔍 Analyzes existing codebase
- 📊 Classifies feature (determines phase 1-6)
- 📝 Generates comprehensive story with all sections
- 🎯 Consults python-architect for design
- 🧪 Consults test-strategist for tests
- ✅ Validates quality (12-point checklist)
- 💾 Saves to `user_stories/phase-{N}/`

**Output:**
```
✅ Story US-2.4 created successfully!
📄 user_stories/phase-2-core/US-2.4-query-caching.md
🚀 Ready to implement with: /implement-user-story US-2.4
```

### 2. Review Generated Story

```bash
cat user_stories/phase-2-core/US-2.4-query-caching.md
```

**Check:**
- ✅ Acceptance criteria match expectations
- ✅ Technical approach is sound
- ✅ Test cases are comprehensive
- ✅ Files identified correctly

### 3. Implement the Feature

```bash
/implement-user-story US-2.4
```

**Automated Steps:**
- Design architecture
- Write code with type hints
- Generate comprehensive tests
- Validate with mypy, ruff, pytest
- Format code
- Update documentation
- Commit to git

### 4. Feature Complete! 🎉

**Total Time**: ~45 minutes from idea to production-ready code

## Generated Story Structure

Every story includes **10 comprehensive sections**:

### 1. Metadata
- Story ID (auto-generated)
- Title
- Phase (1-6)
- LOC estimate
- Dependencies
- Status

### 2. Overview
2-3 sentence description

### 3. User Story
```
As a [role]
I want [capability]
So that [benefit]
```

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
7-10 specific, testable requirements

### 5. Technical Requirements
Detailed implementation specifications

### 6. Design Patterns
2-3 patterns with justification

### 7. Implementation Notes
Best practices, security, performance, gotchas

### 8. Files to Create/Modify
Specific file paths

### 9. Test Cases
10-20 detailed test scenarios

### 10. Definition of Done
Comprehensive checklist

### 11. Expected Outcome
Usage examples with code

---

## Phase Classification

Stories are automatically classified into 6 phases:

| Phase | Focus | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **1: Foundation** | Config, security, RBAC | Pydantic models, workspace config |
| **2: Core** | Infrastructure, DB, utilities | Connection manager, query executor |
| **3: Business** | Domain services | Catalog service, table service |
| **4: Chunking** | Response management | Chunking service, token handling |
| **5: Integration** | MCP tools, refactoring | Tool updates, DI container |
| **6: Quality** | Testing, docs, quality | Test suites, type hints |

**Classification Algorithm:**
The story-architect analyzes your feature description and automatically determines the appropriate phase based on keywords, intent, and context.

---

## Quality Validation

### 12-Point Quality Checklist

Every generated story must pass:

1. ✅ Metadata complete (ID, title, phase, LOC, dependencies, status)
2. ✅ Overview clear (2-3 sentences)
3. ✅ User story format correct (As a... I want... So that...)
4. ✅ Acceptance criteria specific (7-10 testable items)
5. ✅ Technical requirements concrete
6. ✅ Design patterns identified (2-3 with justification)
7. ✅ Implementation notes comprehensive
8. ✅ Files listed with specific paths
9. ✅ Test cases detailed (10+ scenarios)
10. ✅ Definition of done complete (10+ items)
11. ✅ Expected outcome includes examples
12. ✅ Dependencies identified

**If validation fails:**
- Story-architect fills gaps automatically
- May ask user for clarification
- Will not save incomplete stories

## Writing Good Feature Descriptions

### ✅ Good Examples

**Specific and clear:**
```
Add query result caching with configurable TTL and LRU eviction strategy
```

**Actionable with context:**
```
Implement connection pooling for database connections with pool size 5-20
```

**Purpose-driven:**
```
Add support for Delta Lake time travel queries to enable point-in-time analysis
```

**Well-scoped:**
```
Create export functionality for table data in CSV, JSON, and Parquet formats
```

### ❌ Bad Examples

**Too vague:**
```
Make it faster
```

**Too broad:**
```
Add all Delta Lake features
```

**No purpose:**
```
Add a service
```

**Missing context:**
```
Implement caching
```

### Template for Success

```
Add/Implement/Create {FEATURE} to {GOAL/PURPOSE}
[Optional: with {SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENTS}]
```

    USER[User Request] --> ARCH[🟠 Story Architect<br/>Orchestrator]
    ARCH -->|Design Guidance| PY[🔴 Python Architect<br/>Architecture Expert]
    ARCH -->|Test Scenarios| TEST[🟡 Test Strategist<br/>Testing Expert]
    PY --> ARCH
    TEST --> ARCH
    ARCH --> STORY[📄 Complete Story]

    style USER fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff
    style ARCH fill:#FF9800,color:#fff
    style PY fill:#E91E63,color:#fff
    style TEST fill:#FFC107,color:#000
    style STORY fill:#2196F3,color:#fff
```

**Collaboration Benefits:**
- Python-architect provides design patterns and architecture
- Test-strategist generates comprehensive test scenarios
- Story-architect synthesizes expert input
- Result: Professional-grade user stories

## Advanced Features

### Story Refinement

If the generated story needs adjustments:

```bash
# Initial generation
/define-user-story "Add caching"

# System response:
"I need more details. Could you clarify:
1. What should be cached?
2. Cache strategy (LRU, TTL, size-based)?
3. Performance requirements?"

# Refined request
/define-user-story "Add query result caching with LRU eviction and 5-minute TTL"

# Perfect! Story generated.
```

### Iterative Improvement

After generation, request specific changes:

```
"Can you add more detail about the caching strategy in US-2.4?"
"Can you add test cases for concurrent cache access in US-2.4?"
"Can you update the LOC estimate in US-3.5 based on similar features?"
```

The system will update specific sections while preserving the rest.

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Before (Execution Only)

```bash
# Had to write story manually (2-4 hours)
# Then:
/implement-user-story US-3.4  # Automated implementation
```

### After (Complete Lifecycle)

```bash
/define-user-story "feature description"  # 5-10 min
/implement-user-story US-3.4              # 30-45 min
# Done! 45-55 minutes total
```

### Seamless Integration

The frameworks work together perfectly:
- Story format identical (manual vs. generated)
- No changes to implementation framework
- Same quality standards maintained
- Same agent patterns used

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Context

```bash
# Good - provides context
/define-user-story "Add caching to QueryExecutor to reduce redundant database calls"

# Less good - missing context
/define-user-story "Add caching"
```

### 2. Be Specific

```bash
# Good - specific requirements
/define-user-story "Implement connection pooling with pool size 5-20 and connection timeout 30s"

# Less good - vague
/define-user-story "Make connections better"
```

### 3. State the Goal

```bash
# Good - clear benefit
/define-user-story "Add export functionality to enable users to download analysis results"

# Less good - no purpose
/define-user-story "Add export feature"
```

### 4. One Feature Per Story

```bash
# Good - focused
/define-user-story "Add CSV export support"

# Less good - too broad
/define-user-story "Add CSV, JSON, and Parquet export"  # Split into 3 stories
```

### 5. Review Before Implementation

Always review generated stories:
- Check acceptance criteria
- Verify technical approach
- Confirm test coverage
- Validate file changes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Story Generation Takes Long

**Cause:** Complex feature requiring extensive consultation
**Solution:** This is normal (10-15 min). For faster results, break into smaller stories.

### Issue: Phase Classification Incorrect

**Cause:** Ambiguous feature description
**Solution:** Explicitly mention if it's config, core service, business logic, etc.

### Issue: Dependencies Not Detected

**Cause:** Related code not obvious from description
**Solution:** Mention specific services/modules you're extending

### Issue: Test Cases Don't Match Expectations

**Cause:** Acceptance criteria didn't capture requirements
**Solution:** Request refinement with specific test scenarios

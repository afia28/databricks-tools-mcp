## Usage Examples

### Explicit Invocation
Subagents can be invoked explicitly in Claude Code:

```bash
# User Story Finalizer (CRITICAL - Use after completing features)
"I've finished implementing the performance monitoring user story"
"The batch processing feature is complete, please finalize it"
"Finalize and prepare US-4.2 for merge to main"

# Story Architect (Generate User Stories)
"Generate a user story for adding query result caching"
"Create a story for implementing connection pooling with configurable pool size"
"I need a story for adding Delta Lake time travel support"

# Python Architecture
"Review the DataProcessor class architecture and suggest improvements"
"Help me design Pydantic models for the processing engine with proper validation"
"Add comprehensive type hints to the processor module"

# Data Engineering
"Optimize the bulk loading strategy for transferring large datasets"
"Design schema mapping between different data sources"
"Design an incremental data processing strategy for daily updates"

# Test Strategy
"Create comprehensive tests for the new batch processing function"
"The integration tests are failing in the CI pipeline"
"Our configuration module only has 60% test coverage"

# DevOps & Configuration
"Design a user-friendly CLI interface for the application"
"Improve the YAML configuration validation and error messages"
"Set up production-ready logging and monitoring"
```

### Automatic Delegation
Claude Code will automatically delegate tasks to appropriate subagents based on context:
- **Story definition** â†’ story-architect (via `/define-user-story` command)
- **Feature completion** â†’ user-story-finalizer (CRITICAL - always invoked)
- **Database operations** â†’ data-engineer
- **New feature implementation** â†’ test-strategist (for tests)
- **Configuration changes** â†’ devops-config
- **Class/model design** â†’ python-architect

### Proactive Invocation
Certain agents are invoked proactively:
- **story-architect**: By `/define-user-story` command for story generation
- **user-story-finalizer**: ALWAYS after feature completion is declared
- **data-engineer**: When database operations are detected
- **test-strategist**: After implementing new features
- **devops-config**: For configuration and CLI tasks

2. **ALWAYS use user-story-finalizer** when:
   - Declaring any feature or user story complete
   - Before merging any branch to main
   - After implementing significant changes
   - To ensure production readiness
   - **This is CRITICAL and NON-NEGOTIABLE**

3. **Start with python-architect** when:
   - Beginning a new feature to design the architecture
   - Refactoring existing code for better structure
   - Optimizing performance at the code level

4. **Consult data-engineer** for:
   - Any Databricks or DuckDB specific operations
   - Performance issues with data transfer
   - Schema mapping challenges

5. **Engage test-strategist** to:
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage
   - Debug complex test failures
   - Design test strategies for new features

6. **Use devops-config** for:
   - User-facing interfaces (CLI, configuration)
   - Production deployment planning
   - Error handling and user experience

```

## Management

Use the `/agents` command in Claude Code to:
- View all available subagents with their configurations
- Create new project-specific subagents
- Edit existing subagent definitions
- Manage tool permissions and capabilities
- Check agent invocation history

## Technical Implementation

Each agent is defined with:
- **YAML frontmatter**: Metadata including name, description, model, color, and tools
- **System prompt**: Detailed instructions about expertise, responsibilities, and approach
- **Examples**: Specific use cases with context and expected behavior
- **Guidelines**: Project-specific patterns and conventions to follow

These subagents are project-specific and designed to support the development workflow with specialized expertise.

# Implementing User Story: $1

You are implementing user story **$1** for this project. Execute this implementation systematically using the TodoWrite tool to track progress.

## üöÄ EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### üî• CRITICAL: MANDATORY DELEGATION STRATEGY
**ALL implementation work MUST be delegated to specialized subagents.**
- The main conversation is for coordination ONLY
- NO direct file editing, test running, or code implementation in main conversation
- Each task type has a designated specialist agent that MUST be used

### Step 1: Initialize and Validate Context
```bash
# First, create a comprehensive task list using TodoWrite tool
```
Use TodoWrite to create tasks for:
- Validate project structure and dependencies
- Analyze user story requirements
- Design implementation approach (DELEGATE to python-architect)
- Implement core functionality (DELEGATE to python-architect or data-engineer)
- Create comprehensive test suite (DELEGATE to test-strategist)
- Validate implementation (DELEGATE to user-story-finalizer)
- Run quality checks (DELEGATE to appropriate specialist)

### Step 2: Project Context Discovery
!`echo "üìä Project Structure:"; find src/ tests/ -type f -name "*.py" | sort`
!`echo "üìù Git Status:"; git status --short`
!`echo "üîç Dependencies:"; grep -E "^[a-z]" pyproject.toml | head -20`
!`echo "‚úÖ Test Coverage:"; ls tests/test_*.py 2>/dev/null | wc -l`

### Step 3: Requirements Analysis
**CRITICAL**: First locate and analyze the user story definition:
1. Search conversation history for story ID "$1"
2. Extract ALL acceptance criteria (mark as todos)
3. Identify test requirements (mark as todos)
4. Document technical constraints

If user story "$1" is not found in context:
```
‚ùå ERROR: User story "$1" not found in conversation context.
Please provide the user story definition or use a valid story ID.
Available stories might include: US-2.1, US-2.2, US-3.1, etc.
```

### Step 4: Implementation Strategy

**üî• MANDATORY: Use specialized subagents for ALL work:**
- **python-architect**: MUST use for class design, Pydantic models, code implementation
- **data-engineer**: MUST use for database optimization, data pipeline performance
- **test-strategist**: MUST use for test design, test execution, debugging
- **devops-config**: MUST use for CLI, configuration, YAML validation
- **user-story-finalizer**: MUST use for final validation and git operations

**Delegation Pattern (REQUIRED):**
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always delegate to specialist
Task.invoke(
    subagent_type="python-architect",
    description="Implement user story core functionality",
    prompt="""Implement the core functionality for user story $1:
    - Requirements: [detailed requirements]
    - Files to modify: [list files]
    - Standards: Type hints, docstrings, error handling
    """
)

# ‚ùå WRONG - Never implement directly in main conversation
# Do NOT use Edit, Write, or Bash tools directly here
```

### Step 5: Core Implementation

**üî• DELEGATION REQUIRED:**
Do NOT implement directly. Instead:
```python
# Delegate ALL implementation to appropriate specialist
Task.invoke(
    subagent_type="python-architect",  # or "data-engineer" for DB work
    description="Implement core functionality",
    prompt="""[Detailed implementation requirements]"""
)
```

**The subagent will handle:**
1. Using Glob to find related existing files
2. Using Read to understand current implementation
3. Using MultiEdit for batch modifications
4. Using Write only for new files

**B. Code Standards Enforcement:**
- Type hints: REQUIRED for all public methods
- Docstrings: Google style with Args, Returns, Raises, Examples
- Logging: Use `logger = loguru.logger` pattern
- Validation: Pydantic v2 models for all data structures
- Error handling: Specific exceptions with clear messages

**C. Implementation Checklist:**
‚òê All acceptance criteria implemented
‚òê Proper error handling with custom exceptions
‚òê Comprehensive logging at appropriate levels
‚òê Type hints on all public APIs
‚òê Docstrings with examples
‚òê Integration with existing codebase verified

### Step 6: Test Implementation

**üî• DELEGATION REQUIRED:**
```python
# MUST delegate ALL test work to test-strategist
Task.invoke(
    subagent_type="test-strategist",
    description="Create comprehensive test suite",
    prompt="""Create comprehensive tests for user story $1:
    - Test all acceptance criteria
    - Include happy path, error handling, edge cases
    - Use parametrized tests where appropriate
    - Achieve 90%+ coverage
    """
)
```

**DO NOT run tests directly. The test-strategist will:**
- Design test structure and patterns
- Create test implementations
- Run tests and analyze results
- Debug any failures

### Step 7: Quality Validation

**üî• DELEGATION REQUIRED:**
```python
# MUST delegate validation to user-story-finalizer
Task.invoke(
    subagent_type="user-story-finalizer",
    description="Validate and finalize implementation",
    prompt="""Validate the implementation of user story $1:
    - Run all quality checks (mypy, black, ruff, pytest)
    - Fix any issues found
    - Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
    - Update documentation as needed
    """
)
```

**DO NOT run validation commands directly. The finalizer will handle all checks.**

### Step 8: Integration Verification

**Verify no regressions:**
!`pytest tests/ --tb=short -q`
!`python -c "import sys; print('‚úÖ Package imports working')"`

## üîÑ MANDATORY POST-IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

**IMPORTANT**: After completing the core implementation, you MUST execute the following commands in sequence:

### Step 9: Run Comprehensive Tests
**The `/run-tests` command will delegate to test-strategist:**
```bash
/run-tests coverage
```
This command will:
- DELEGATE to test-strategist agent
- Run all unit and integration tests
- Generate coverage report
- Debug any failing tests
- Ensure 90%+ coverage for new code

### Step 10: Validate Implementation
**The `/validate-implementation` command will delegate to user-story-finalizer:**
```bash
/validate-implementation
```
This command will:
- DELEGATE to user-story-finalizer agent
- Run all tests again
- Execute type checking with mypy
- Check code formatting with black
- Run linting with ruff
- Verify import integrity
- Ensure coverage requirements are met

### Step 11: Apply Linting and Formatting
**The `/lint` command will delegate to python-architect:**
```bash
/lint
```
This command will:
- DELEGATE to python-architect agent
- Auto-format code with black
- Sort imports with isort
- Apply flake8 style rules
- Run comprehensive pylint checks
- Ensure code meets all style guidelines

### Step 12: Update Documentation and Complete
**Execute `/update-documentation` command to finalize:**
```bash
/update-documentation
```
This will:
- Update README.md with new features
- Update CLAUDE.md status and metrics
- Check git status for all changes
- Generate detailed commit message
- Commit all changes to git
- Push to remote repository
- Create/update pull request if needed
- Merge with main branch when ready

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

The implementation is ONLY complete when:
‚úÖ All acceptance criteria are met
‚úÖ `/run-tests coverage` shows all tests passing with 90%+ coverage
‚úÖ `/validate-implementation` passes all checks
‚úÖ `/lint` shows no issues or auto-fixes applied
‚úÖ `/update-documentation` has committed and pushed all changes
‚úÖ TodoWrite shows all tasks completed
‚úÖ Code is merged to main branch

## üö® ERROR RECOVERY

If implementation fails at any step:
1. Mark current task as blocked in TodoWrite
2. Add new task for fixing the issue
3. Use appropriate subagent for expertise
4. Re-run validation after fix
5. Continue with remaining tasks

## üí° PROACTIVE ENHANCEMENTS

After core implementation, consider:
- Performance optimizations (consult data-engineer subagent)
- Additional error scenarios (consult test-strategist subagent)
- CLI improvements (consult devops-config subagent)
- Architectural improvements (consult python-architect subagent)

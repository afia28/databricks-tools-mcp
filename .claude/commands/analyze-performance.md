# Performance Analysis

## üî• CRITICAL: MANDATORY DELEGATION

**ALL performance analysis MUST be delegated to the data-engineer agent.**
- The main conversation is for coordination ONLY
- NO direct performance analysis or profiling in main conversation
- The data-engineer has expertise in database optimization, ETL patterns, and performance tuning

## Analysis Target: $1

### üéØ Delegation to Data Engineer

I will now delegate performance analysis to the data-engineer agent who will:
1. Profile code and database operations
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Analyze memory usage
4. Recommend optimizations
5. Provide tuning strategies

```python
# Delegating to data-engineer for performance analysis
Task.invoke(
    subagent_type="data-engineer",
    description="Analyze and optimize performance",
    prompt="""Perform comprehensive performance analysis for the project.

    Analysis target: ${1:-entire project}

    PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS TASKS:

    1. SYSTEM RESOURCE ANALYSIS:
       ‚úì Check CPU cores and memory available
       ‚úì Analyze Python version and dependencies
       ‚úì Review system configuration
       ‚úì Identify resource constraints

       Commands:
       - python -c "import psutil; print(f'CPU: {psutil.cpu_count()}, RAM: {psutil.virtual_memory().total/(1024**3):.1f}GB')"
       - uv pip list | grep -E "(pandas|numpy|pyarrow|sqlalchemy)"

    2. CODE PERFORMANCE PROFILING:
       ‚úì Analyze target module/function: ${1:-all modules}
       ‚úì Identify performance-critical code paths
       ‚úì Check for inefficient patterns

       ‚úì Check garbage collection impact
       ‚úì Measure peak memory usage

       Use tracemalloc and memory_profiler:
       ```python
       import tracemalloc
       tracemalloc.start()
       # Code to profile
       current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
       ```

       - Memory: Low
       - Speed: 2-5x baseline
       - Best for: Small datasets

       OPTIMIZED:
       - Overhead: Medium
       - Memory: Medium
       - Speed: 10-50x baseline
       - Best for: Medium datasets

       ADVANCED:
       - Overhead: Low
       - Memory: Medium
       - Speed: 50-100x baseline

    7. OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:

       BATCH SIZE TUNING:
       Based on data characteristics:
       - Small datasets (<10MB): 10,000 rows
       - Medium datasets (10MB-1GB): 100,000 rows
       - Large datasets (>1GB): 500,000-1,000,000 rows

       MEMORY MANAGEMENT:
       - Use generators for large datasets
       - Implement proper cleanup
       - Configure database memory limits
       - Use connection pooling

       PARALLEL PROCESSING:
       - Consider multiprocessing for multiple data entities
       - Async I/O for network operations
       - Batch processing strategies

    8. BENCHMARKING FRAMEWORK:
       Provide specific benchmark code:
       ```python
       from contextlib import contextmanager
       import time
       import psutil

       @contextmanager
       def performance_monitor(operation_name):
           start_time = time.time()
           start_memory = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss
           yield
           duration = time.time() - start_time
           memory_delta = psutil.Process().memory_info().rss - start_memory
           print(f"{operation_name}: {duration:.2f}s, {memory_delta/1024/1024:.1f}MB")
       ```

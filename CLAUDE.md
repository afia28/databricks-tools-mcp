3. **Automatic Chunking**: Responses exceeding 9000 tokens are automatically chunked
4. **13 MCP Tools**: Comprehensive Databricks Unity Catalog exploration

## Adding to Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "databricks-tools": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/Users/ahmed/PycharmProjects/PythonProject/databricks-tools-clean",
        "databricks-tools"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for all configuration options.

**Analyst Mode (Default):**
- Uses `DATABRICKS_*` variables only
- Single workspace access

**Developer Mode:**
- Uses prefixed variables (e.g., `PRODUCTION_DATABRICKS_*`)
- Multiple workspace access

## Available MCP Tools

1. `list_workspaces` - List configured workspaces
2. `get_table_row_count` - Count rows in a table
3. `get_table_details` - Fetch table schema and data
4. `run_query` - Execute SQL queries
5. `list_catalogs` - List all catalogs
6. `list_schemas` - List schemas in catalogs
7. `list_tables` - List tables in schemas
8. `list_columns` - List columns with metadata
9. `list_user_functions` - List UDFs in catalog.schema
10. `describe_function` - Describe a specific UDF
11. `list_and_describe_all_functions` - List and describe all UDFs
12. `get_chunk` - Retrieve chunked response data
13. `get_chunking_session_info` - Get chunk session info

## Making Changes

For incremental improvements:
1. Make small, focused changes
2. Test immediately with `uv run databricks-tools`
3. Run linting: `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .`
4. Commit frequently

## Troubleshooting

- **Import errors**: Run `uv sync` to install dependencies
- **Connection errors**: Check `.env` file has correct credentials
- **Token errors**: Verify Databricks tokens haven't expired
- **MCP errors**: Test with `uv run databricks-tools` directly

### Creating New Documentation

When creating new documentation files, follow these rules:

1. **User-facing guides** → `docs/guides/`
2. **Technical architecture docs** → `docs/architecture/`
3. **Development processes** → `docs/development/`
4. **Code examples** → `examples/`
5. **Project-wide changes** → Update `CHANGELOG.md` in root
6. **Quick reference** → Update `README.md` in root

For more detailed guidelines, see `.claude/DOCUMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md`
